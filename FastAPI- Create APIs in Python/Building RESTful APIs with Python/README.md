In this Python tutorial you will learn 
about FastAPI, a Web framework for developing 
RESTful APIs in Python. FastAPI is based on 
Pydantic and type hints to validate, serialize, 
and deserialize data, and automatically 
auto-generate OpenAPI documents. 

It fully supports asynchronous programming and 
can run with Uvicorn and Gunicorn.
