### Setting up Python Virtual Environment and Auto generating requirements.txt file with all the required modules

#### Step-1: Install Python3-evv
```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install python3-venv -y
```

#### Step-2: Create and activate a Python Virtual Environment
```bash
mkdir test_python_project
python3 -m venv test_project_venv
ls -l 
source test_project_venv/bin/activate  # this will activate the python virtual environment
deactivate                        # to deactivate python virtual environment
```

#### Step-3: Successfully generate the requirements.txt for your test python project
**CheckList**
- [x] into the python virtual environment
- [x] you have a project which requires numpy and pandas. [My Sample Project](test_python_project/sample_file.py)
- [x] Your virtual environment might not have this nampy and pandas module installed
- [x] Make sure you can generate a requirements.txt file only for the modules requires
- [x] Install the modules at autogenerated requirements.txt file with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
```bash
vim test_python_project/sample_file.py                       # create a sample python file which will do the numpy and pandas operations. Find the source code in the project     

#@at virtual environment
pip3 install pipreqs
pipreqs test_python_project/                          # This will generate the requirements.txt for your current project
pip3 install -r test_python_project/requirements.txt  # this will install all the modules requires to make your project executable
python3 test_python_project/sample_file.py                   # Now execute the python project and it will be working fine
```
