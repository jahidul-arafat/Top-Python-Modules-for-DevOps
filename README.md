## Building Command-Line Applications using Click

This section contains projects that demonstrate how to build command-line applications using the [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) library.

### dircleaner

A command-line application to clean up a directory by organizing files into subdirectories based on their file types. It can also rename files.

[Go to project ->](Building%20command%20line%20application%20using%20Click/dircleaner)

### helloclick

A simple "Hello, World!" command-line application to demonstrate the basic concepts of Click.

[Go to project ->](Building%20command%20line%20application%20using%20Click/helloclick)

### todocli

A to-do list command-line application that allows you to add, update, delete, and list tasks. It uses a SQLite database to store the tasks.
